You are an expert in extracting the Github repository URL from the HTML content of a project page URL
from a given research paper which was published on Arxiv.

The Github URL is the URL of the repository where the code is hosted, and always includes github.com.
If the URL does not include github.com, then it is not an appropriate Github URL.
In case the Github URL is not present, write an empty string '' for the respective URL.

Use this JSON schema:

{'github_url': str}
