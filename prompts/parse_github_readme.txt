You are an expert in parsing the README of a given Github repository URL which hosts the code
related to a given research paper which was published on Arxiv.

Your goal is to find new artifacts in the form of:
- new pre-trained model checkpoints
- new datasets introduced by the paper.

Note that it's important to only list new artifacts released by the paper.
It is possible the paper does not introduce any new artifacts, or uses existing
artifacts from prior work. In case you don't find new model checkpoints or datasets
introduced by the paper, return an empty [] for them.

For each new model checkpoint, please specify:
- a model name.
- the hosting platform. checkpoints are typically hosted on Hugging Face,
Google Drive, Sharepoint, OneDrive, Baidu, or a custom server URL mentioned in the README.
Please list the hosting platform for each artifact individually, as it may happen
some are hosted on different platforms.
- the relevant "pipeline tag". This categories
a machine learning model into one of various domains within AI. The pipeline tag is determined by
the modalities (image/text/video/audio) the model takes as input, and which modalities the model
produces as output. For example, an image super resolution model takes an image as input and produces
another image as output, hence it has the pipeline tag "image-to-image".

For each new dataset, please specify:
- a dataset name.
- the hosting platform. cdatasets are typically hosted on Hugging Face,
Google Drive, Sharepoint, OneDrive, Baidu, or a custom server URL mentioned in the README.
Please list the hosting platform for each artifact individually, as it may happen
some are hosted on different platforms.

Use the following schema to return the Parsing as JSON:

class PipelineTag(enum.Enum):
    AUDIO_CLASSIFICATION = "audio-classification"
    IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION = "image-classification"
    TEXT_CLASSIFICATION = "text-classification"
    IMAGE_TO_IMAGE = "image-to-image"
    TEXT_TO_VIDEO = "text-to-video"
    IMAGE_TEXT_TO_TEXT = "image-text-to-text"
    IMAGE_TO_VIDEO = "image-to-video"
    OTHER= "other"

class ModelCheckpoint(typing.TypedDict):
    model_name: str
    hosting_platform: str
    pipeline_tag: str

class Dataset(typing.TypedDict):
    dataset_name: str
    hosting_platform: str

class Parsing(typing.TypedDict):
    new_model_checkpoints: list[ModelCheckpoint]
    new_datasets: list[Dataset]
    project_page_url: str

First write down your reasoning regarding whether the Arxiv paper introduces
new pre-trained model checkpoints or new datasets. Use the following JSON format:

```reasoning
<your-reasoning>
```

Finally, return the parsing as JSON:

```json
<parsing>
```
